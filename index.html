        <h1>Adventures of Krish and Shreeya</h1>
        <p><em>Quarantine Diaries - Making the best of the worst</em>
          <p>Krish is 7 years and Shreeya is 1 nearing two . They have unique personalities and love each other very much . Krish is methodical, intelligent and and a stickler for rules &#10084;, where Shreeya is sweet, clever and bossy. She knows
            how to
            get
            her way.

  <h3>Things they like to eat</h3>
  <ul><strong>Krish's favorite food</strong>
    <li>Pizza - Click <a href="https://watch.foodnetwork.com/tv-shows/tylers-ultimate/full-episodes/ultimate-pizza">here</a> for ideas on how to throw a pizza party ( this is what krish wants )</li>
    <li>pancakes - Click <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234702/quick-almond-flour-pancakes/">here</a> for delicious almond flour pancake recipes . They are so good ! and Krish has no idea that they are super healthy ! </li>
    <li>cookies,cakes,brownies and fruit loops - click <a href="https://foolproofliving.com/almond-flour-recipes/">here</a> for more alomond flour based recipes ( assuming you do not have a nut allergy !)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am sure you see a pattern here. He loves junk food, getting him to eat healthy requies a lot of talking convincing and deals.</p>
  <ul><strong>Shreeya's favorite food</strong>
    <li>All fruits - Oranges , bananas ( or as she likes to call them "nana"), strawberries, blueberries, apples to name a few</li>
    <li>Oats , rice , whole wheat rotis</li>
    <li>Cashew nuts</li>
    <li>Yogurt</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I know you what you are thinking ! Atleast she eats healthy, but she has the appetite of that of a bird &#10084; (maybe a sparrow)</p>
